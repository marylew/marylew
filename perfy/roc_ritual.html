      <p><span style="font-size: 16px; color:gray">all images and video montage by Chris Reeg</span> <br><br><br>Just a year after Bloody Noes' inception, we heard about - of all things - a "Performance Art Competition" in Rochester. Sponsored by ROCO and staged in MUCCC (when it was a theater-in-the-round), this would be more than a showcase, but an event with 'judges' who would rate and rank the best and worst Performance Art that Rochester had to offer. Kind of an odd call for a town that hadn't really positioned itself as supporting Performance Art (as a form specifically <i>other</i> than theater or music performance) heretofore in any particular way...<br><br>
          Bloody Noes went for it in a cocky way, brought out our most ambiguous props and potent gestures, and took first prize - a check and a chance to headline a performance art showcase at MUCCC. The showcase ended up being a familiar line-up, us and our noise buds ORAA and Tumul that we regularly performed with ... but this time on a Stage at a Theatre. <br><br>I do feel sad and weird that the event was A Competition - there was one group, a couple that did something strange and sort of mummenschanz that didn't rank and was never seen or heard from again. Who are you interesting couple? There was also a boy with an acoustic guitar who did a nervous set of coffeehouse music - later we learned that 'it was an act' made to drown the audience in cringe - a painful portrayal of an awkward musician - and we we had just fallen for it. Performance art is hard, guys.
        <br><br>Finally I want to say (should you still be reading) that Bloody Noes has never really identified as 'performance art'. We were born as a noise band and skew towards the visual and action-oriented. Noise itself is the performance art twisted twin of Music - stripping down the entertainments found in rhythm, sound, and instrument to raw components of sonic experience. This was recognizeable to the audience-judges of the competition, who chose a whole slate of noise performers executing perfectly ordinary noise music to embody the performance art showcase. (Or maybe the audience was just stacked with noise fans.)<br><br>But to my understanding (and here I speak for me Mary and not necessarily Ian) Bloody Noes are slightly too entertaining to be true performance artists. We aren't devoted to the raw action-of-doing as much as the ability of the raw action to produce spectacle. We are complicated and atmospheric, preoccupied with the mystification of the audience over the simplicity of activity. I know these are fine hairs to split, but I hold tight to my pure definition and respect for the high form Performance Art. We got through that competition much as the coffeeshop boy - acting out what Performance Art might appear to be to people more familiar with Theater or Art. But at heart we posed a theatrical pretense rather than a commited actuality, which is the only thing Performance Art should ever do.  <br><br>
